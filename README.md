## Introduction: ##
Embark on an extraordinary voyage that transcends the confines of time and space. Here, all motion ceases, giving way to an encompassing void. I invite you to unearth the hidden secrets, explore what once was absent, and experience the enchantment of the Al-Jazar Mosque.


## Background of the Game Environment: ##
My game is set within the Al-Jazar Mosque in Acre, a structure steeped in rich cultural history. Through the medium of Virtual Reality, I aim to offer players an immersive exploration of this unique edifice. By creating an interactive digital facsimile of this ancient and enigmatic building, I ensure its virtual perpetuity. The in-game model has been meticulously crafted based on the real Al-Jazar Mosque, featuring avatars that represent the locals performing traditional rituals, such as kneeling and performing Alwudu, faithfully depicting the life within the mosque. In order to enrich the gaming experience and stimulate exploratory behavior, I've also incorporated symbolic sculptures of spiritual strength. (For the keen-eyed players, you may even spot some familiar local felines.)


## Gameplay Instructions: ##
Players are tasked with conducting a comprehensive scan of the entire game environment until every element has been discovered. 

(The game currently supports the emission of up to 10,000,000 particles.)

Gameplay is facilitated via a head-mounted VR device and handheld controllers. The controls are as follows:

1. Navigate your avatar using the Primary Thumbstick on the left controller.

2. Use Button Y on the left controller to elevate your avatar to a height of "40".

3. Initiate a full-screen linear scan, accompanied by sound effects, using the Start Button on the left controller.

4. Toggle between four particle colors using Button X on the left controller.

5. Execute a circular scan, accompanied by sound effects, using the PrimaryIndexTrigger on the right controller.

   (There are four available sizes for the circular scan.)

6. Direct your avatar's line of sight using the PrimaryThumbstick on the right controller.

7. Use Button A on the right controller to increase the scope of the circular scan.

8. Use Button B on the right controller to decrease the scope of the circular scan.

9. Use the PrimaryHandTrigger on the right controller to execute a minor horizontal linear particle scan, accompanied by sound effects.


## Additional Features: ##

1. Background music for an immersive gaming experience.

2. Display of the current number of emitted particles in the top-left corner of the interface.

3. FPS (Frames Per Second) value displayed in the top-left corner of the interface.

Revised Translation: While this resource is undoubtedly excellent, what truly captivates me is its remarkable performance within the realm of VR gaming.
